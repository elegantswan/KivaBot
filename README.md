## Description
Replication of Kiva robots used in Amazon fullfilment centers that move pods around map given commands from user. Objective is for user to navigate Kiva towards a pod, pick it up, and transport it into a designated zone where it will drop the pod. User has to avoid obstacles while moving throughout map and make sure Kiva go out of bounds on the map.

## Features
- 6 possible commands from user: forward, back, left, right, pickup, drop
- Returns successful or failure result depending on if pod dropped off at   designated drop zone.
- Maps include obstacles and out of bounds areas for Kiva to avoid. Unit tests are included to catch edge cases where Kiva runs into obstacle or runs out of bounds.

## Instructions
- Create new instance of remote control class.
- You will then be prompted to choose one of several maps available. These vary in # of obstacles and different drop and pickup zones.
- User is prompted to input movement commands (L, R, F, B, T, D). These are left, right, forward, backward, take, and drop functions respectively.
- Result will return either a success or failure case depending on if pod is dropped at correct zone. All other cases will result in failure.
